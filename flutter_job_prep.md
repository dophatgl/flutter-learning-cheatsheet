# Preparing for a Flutter Engineer Job

## 1️⃣ Polish Your Flutter & Dart Skills
- **Master the Fundamentals:** Ensure you're confident with Dart (async/await, isolates, mixins, extensions).
- **State Management:** Be comfortable with Provider, Riverpod, Bloc, or any preferred approach.
- **Animations & UI/UX:** Build smooth animations using `AnimationController` and `CustomPainter`.
- **Networking & API Integration:** Work with REST APIs and WebSockets using `http`, `dio`, and `socket.io`.
- **Local Storage & Database:** Know `Hive`, `SharedPreferences`, `Isar`, or `SQLite` with `drift`.
- **Dependency Injection:** Use `get_it` or `riverpod` for better modularity.

## 2️⃣ Build Real-World Projects
If you haven't already, create at least **two solid apps** that showcase your skills:
- A **complex CRUD app** (e.g., Task Manager, Notes App)
- An **app with Firebase/Backend integration** (e.g., Chat App, Social Media Clone)

Make sure your apps:
✅ Have a well-structured architecture (MVVM, Clean Architecture)
✅ Follow best practices (separation of concerns, SOLID principles)
✅ Include unit, widget, and integration tests
